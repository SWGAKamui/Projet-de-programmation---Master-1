----- CSS FOLDER -----


This folder supposedly contains all CSS implementation of the project.

The fact that we use MaterializeCSS given css files, it's very hard to separate our
own css code from MaterializeCSS's.

This explains why this repository is empty.

All CSS files are found under /vendor/materialize/.
