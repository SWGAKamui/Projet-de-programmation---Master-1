---- Concerning the file "shuffleComplement.js" ----

It contains functions dealing with the links between map-shuffle-reduce.

We implemented these functions (and classes) but later removed them because
our client specified the unnecessary linking between map-shuffle-reduce
 and that a map-reduce linking was enough.

We kept this file for possible need later by people who'd be interested 
to continue the project.
